# FORK

This is a fork from the original repo.
It seemed to have stopped development.
So it is maintained here now.

Things this fork has added:

- Chat
- Support for chat based models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
- Document Q/A (using indexer for handling out-of-context sized content)

## Environment variables

This uses the OPEN_API_KEY from the enviroment. It is supposed to be set to your OpenAI key.

## Default model

The default model used is gpt-3.5-turbo.
Change that in this file, if you want:

[lua/nvim-magic-openai/init.lua](https://github.com/Ricardicus/nvim-magic/blob/master/lua/nvim-magic-openai/init.lua)

# nvim-magic

A pluggable framework for integrating AI code assistance into Neovim. The goals are to make using AI code assistance unobtrusive, and to make it easy to create and share new flows that use AI code assistance. Go to [quickstart](#quickstart) for how to install. It currently works with [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/).

## Features

- Completion
- Docstring
- Alteration
- Chat
- Document Q/A

When using chat, the window you focus on when you start the chat will be
selected for the rest of the session. Until nvim is closed or until you
manually reset the chat (<Leader>mcc). If text is selected in the visual,
this information is passed along the question but hidden from the convo-window.
See the demo gif below.

### Chat (`<Leader>mcc`)

### Document Q/A (`<Leader>mcq`)

Aks questions about documents, don't worry about their size. You need to set up a window for chat before hand.
The cursor needs to be in the document that you want to query about.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- latest stable version of Neovim (nightly may work as well)
- `curl`
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

```lua
-- using packer.nvim
use({
	'ricardicus/nvim-magic',
	config = function()
		require('nvim-magic').setup()
	end,
	requires = {
		'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',
		'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'
	}
})
```

See [docs/config.md](docs/config.md) if you want to override the default configuration e.g. to turn off the default keymaps, or use a different OpenAI engine than the default one (`davinci-codex`). Your OpenAI account might not have access to `davinci-codex` if it is not in the OpenAI Codex private beta (as of 2022-02-02).

Your API key should be made available to your Neovim session in an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. See [docs/openai.md](docs/openai.md) for more details. Note that API calls may be charged for by OpenAI depending on the engine used.

```shell
 export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

### Keymaps

These flows have keymaps set by default for visual mode selections (though you can disable this by passing `use_default_keymap = false` in the setup config).

You can map your own key sequences to the predefined `<Plug>`s if you don't want to use the default keymaps.

| `<Plug>`                               | default keymap | mode   | action                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-append-completion`   | `<Leader>mcs`  | visual | Fetch and append completion                  |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-suggest-alteration`  | `<Leader>mss`  | visual | Ask for an alteration to the selected text   |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-suggest-docstring`   | `<Leader>mds`  | visual | Generate a docstring                         |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-suggest-chat`        | `<Leader>mcc`  | visual | Chat, ask questions. Keep the window.        |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-suggest-chat-reset`  | `<Leader>mcr`  | visual | Chat, reset history. You can start all over. |
| `<Plug>nvim-magic-doc-qa-chat`         | `<Leader>mcq`  | visual | Ask questions about a document. Needs chat started and cursor in the document. |

## Development

There is a [development container](https://containers.dev/) specified under the [`.devcontainer`](.devcontainer/) directory, that builds and installs the latest stable version of Neovim, and sets it up to use the local `nvim-magic` repo as a plugin.
